# applin-rust-demo
This repo shows how to use <https://crates.io/crates/applin>
from the Applinâ„¢ Server-Driven UI framework <https://www.applin.dev/>.

# Try It
The server runs at `https://rust-demo.applin.dev/` .

You can install
[Applin Tester from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/applin-tester/id6464230000)
and connect to the demo with this link: <applin:https://rust-demo.applin.dev/>.

TODO: Set up a universal link for Applin Tester,
since both crates.io and GitHub refuse to render custom URLs as links.
